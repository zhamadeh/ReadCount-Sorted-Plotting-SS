# Plotting read count ideograms for Strand-seq libraries
This script does the folllowing:

1) print out read-count density plots from BreakpointR
2) orders libraries by either background (low->high), coverage (high->low) or readsPerMb (high->low)
3) prints out a user-specified number of the ordered libraries (eg. 10)
